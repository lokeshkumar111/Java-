Problem statement
You are given an integer ’n’.



Your task is to return a sorted array (in increasing order) containing all the factorial numbers which are less than or equal to ‘n’.



The factorial number is a factorial of a positive integer, like 24 is a factorial number, as it is a factorial of 4.



Note:
In the output, you will see the array returned by you.
Example:
Input: ‘n’ = 7

Output: 1 2 6

Explanation: Factorial numbers less than or equal to ‘7’ are ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘6’.
